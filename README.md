# Tran_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project summary: We live in a society where GPS navigation is a crucial tool to every driver today. 
This GPS can only travel within Colorado and its cities. However, the user does 
have the option to add another city to the map in case the GPS has forgotten to
include that city or the driver want to drive to a city out of state. The user
also has the option of deleting a city if they do not want to go through that city 
at all. The GPS has the option of finding the path with the shortest distance 
and the path with the shortest time. It also includes the option of avoiding toll
and finding the longest path instead of the shortest path. 

The following are all the 10 methods and their inputs:
1) Add road: city1, city 2, distance, speed limit, toll
2) Add city: city
3) Display
4) Shortest distance: city1, city2
5) Shortest time: city1, city2
6) Avoid toll
7) Longest path: city1, city2
8) Show all time and distance: city
9) Delete city: city
10) Delete edges: city

The following are the menu options of the project:
Menu options:
1) Display

7) Show all time and distance
8) Delete city

How to run: Clone Project.cpp, GPS.h, GPS.cpp, and cities.txt and run it in a project using any platform with a C++ compiler. Identical to class assignments.
